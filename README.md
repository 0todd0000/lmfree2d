# lmfree2d: Landmark-free hypothesis tests regarding 2D contour shapes

<br>

### Overview

This repository contains data, Python and R code for conducting parametric or
nonparametric, landmark-free hypothesis testing regarding 2D contour shapes.
Data in this repository are redistributed from the [The 2D Shape Structure Dataset](http://2dshapesstructure.github.io)
under the terms of its [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Landmark-free hypothesis testing results look like those in the figure below. These results
represent mass-multivariate analysis of registered 2D contour data, using [Statistical Parametric
Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_parametric_mapping) and [Statistical non-Parametric
Mapping](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.1058).

This figure depicts mean shapes for each of two groups (A and B), an omnibus p value (representing
the probability that smooth, bivariate continuum data would randomly produce a mean
difference as large as the largest observed difference), and highlighted contour points (hot-colored circles)
representing locations where shape effects were largest.

### Getting started

The best place to start is the notebooks (in the Notebooks folder), which summarize
four different approaches to hypothesis testing for 2D contour shapes:

1. **landmarks_uv**:  &nbsp; &nbsp; univariate analysis of landmarks (i.e., Procrustes ANOVA)
1. **landmarks_massmv**:  &nbsp; &nbsp; mass-multivariate analysis of landmarks 
1. **contours_uv**: &nbsp; &nbsp; landmark-free, univariate analysis of registered contours (i.e., contour-level Procrustes ANOVA)
1. **contours_massmv**:  &nbsp; &nbsp; landmark-free, mass-multivariate analysis of registered contours using Statistical Parametric Mapping 

Note that the results in the figure above correspond to the final method: **contours_massmv**.

Please refer to the notebooks and the papers below for more details.
